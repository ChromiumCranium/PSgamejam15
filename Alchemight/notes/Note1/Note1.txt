INFO ON USING THE INVENTORY:
The individual item slots are not actually objects, they are sprites created using drawGUI 
so that they will (hopefully) stay static while the camera moves. I've set up some functions
to make accessing the inventory a little easier; these can be found in the InventoryFunctions
script. Note that the inventory is a two dimensional array: global.inventory is the array that
reflects the items in each slot, and each element is an array defined by global.items, which
stores the properties of every useable item in the game.

The code is a little scuffed here and there (and I can almost guarentee you'll run into an
index outside range error at some point), so tell me if you need clarifications or need me to
debug my mess.

btw the font for the tooltip is in the repo
